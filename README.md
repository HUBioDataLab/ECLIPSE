# ECLIPSE
**Exploration of Complex Ligand-Protein Interactions through Learning from Systems-level Heterogeneous Biomedical Knowledge Graphs**

ECLIPSE is an AI-powered framework for predicting compoundâ€“protein interactions. By combining advanced graph modeling, comprehensive biomedical knowledge, and pre-trained embeddings, it uncovers hidden relationships within complex biological networks, offering a practical tool for researchers in drug discovery and computational biology.

**ECLIPSE combines:**
- **Large-scale heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs):** We built this integrated KG using our in-house [CROssBAR platform](https://crossbar.kansil.org/about.php), capturing entities, including genes, proteins, drugs, compounds, pathways, diseases, and phenotypes, and their multi-layered interactions.  
- **Feature embeddings from language and graph models:** Each biological entity is represented using learned embeddings, enabling richer context and better predictions.  
- **Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT):** Unlike standard GNNs, HGT leverages node and edge types with type-specific attention, effectively modeling complex and diverse relationships.
